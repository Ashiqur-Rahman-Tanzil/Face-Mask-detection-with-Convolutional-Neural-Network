# Face Mask Detection with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
After the new Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) case spread rapidly in Wuhan-China in December 2019, World Health Organization (WHO) confrmed that this is a dangerous virus which can be spreading from humans to humans through droplets and airborne. The basic aim of the project is to detect the presence of a face mask on human faces
on live streaming video as well as on images.
We have used deep learning to develop our face detector model. A dataset from kaggle of 6200 images is used to build this face mask detector using Python, OpenCV,
TensorFlow, and Keras. Some irresponsible people refuse to wear
face mask with so many excuses. Moreover, developing the face mask
detector is very crucial in this case. The experimental results have done
very well and we believe that this project can be merged with embedded application systems at airports, train stations, workplaces, schools, and 
public places to ensure compliance with the guidelines for public safety. 
From the experimental results, this device is able to detect the people 
who wear or do not wear the face mask accurately even if they are moving to various position.
